## JSEngine
A basic 2D engine written in javascript. It is pretty basic and easy to follow, but it is a good foundation for larger things.
Link for testing [here](drdingleberry.github.io/jsengine/Temples.html).
## Usage
You are going to need to be able to use git. It is available on most Linux distros, but in the event that you are on Windows or Mac, you are going to need [this](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows, and [this](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) for Mac. Be sure to have a localhost of some sort running on your computer, with jsengine.html and the resrc folder in the root.
